## C. Theme System & Visual Language

- **Signal Dark:** Grounded in deep charcoal `#121214` and slate `#1a1a1e`, matching official Signal Desktop dark mode.
- **Signal Light:** Clean minimalist canvas (`#f5f5f8` / `#ffffff`) with subtle borders and clear contrast.
- **Dynamic Accent Color:** Configurable in Appearance settings (Signal Blue, Emerald, Violet, Crimson, Amber, Graphite).
- **Persistence:** Stored in `localStorage` (`signal_theme`) and synced across page reloads with zero flash of unstyled content.

---

## D. Message Actions & Spatial Anchoring

- **Hover Actions Toolbar:** Positioned immediately adjacent to the hovered message bubble (adapts to left for outgoing, right for incoming) with no detached gap.
- **Emoji Picker:** Opens directly above the action bar and bubble.
- **Reaction Result:** Aggregated chips render directly beneath the message bubble with active toggle indicators.
- **Quoted Replies:** Renders with original sender identification, left accent border, and smooth click-to-scroll navigation to the referenced message.

## E. Seed Data

- **Primary Demo Account:** `om` / phone `+919842946727` — Password or OTP `123456`
- **Second Account:** `rahul` / phone `+919842946728` — Password or OTP `123456`
- **Other Demo Users:** `priya`, `arjun`, `neha`, `kavya` — Password or OTP `123456`

### Verification Status & Boundaries

| Component / Flow | Environment | Status | Verification Evidence |
|------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------|
| Backend `/health` endpoint | Production (Railway) | **Verified** | Live HTTP GET returns `{"status":"ok"}` |
| Frontend initial page load | Production (Vercel) | **Verified** | Live HTTP/2 GET returns 307 redirect to `/login` |
| REST API Unit & Integration Tests | Local (.venv) | **Verified** | 11/11 tests passing via `pytest tests/ -k "not visual_qa"` |
| Browser Visual QA & Multi-User Live Suite | Local (Chromium) | **Verified** | Passes via `python tests/visual_qa.py` (screenshots + dual session) |
| Live Production End-to-End Auth & WebSockets | Production (Cross-Origin) | **Configured** | Configured with `SameSite=None`, `Secure=True`, and CORS origin matching; not claimed as post-deployment verified against production live instances without active end-to-end telemetry. |
